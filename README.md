# TriBandEQ
An analog 3-band graphic equalizer built with active filters and operational amplifiers. Center frequencies: 81 Hz, ≈3 kHz, ≈16.7 kHz. Each band is a narrow-band section; bands are mixed with an inverting summer. Operation supports boost (peaks) or cut (notches) depending on summer polarity and injection point.
